Node failures do not prevent survivors from continuing to operate

### Partition Tolerance
The system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss

```

### varnishstat
```
client_conn                                - client connections 
client_req                                 - client requests (multiple requests possible in a single connection)
backend_fail                               - failed requests to a backend
backend_toolate / Backend conn. was closed - a persistent connection was closed
backend_reuse                              - a persistent connection was reused
n_object                                   - number of cached objects
n_wrk                                      - current number of worker threads
n_wrk_create                               - number of threads created (should ideally == n_wrk), if not increase the pool size
n_wrk_failed                               - threads that failed to create 
n_wrk_max / N worker threads limited       - threads that varnish wasn't allowed to create (due to max threads limit or thread_pool_add_delay)
n_wrk_overflow                             - request that had to sit in the queue because a worker wasn't available (bad)
n_wrk_drop                                 - requests that varnish rejected because the queue was full (very bad)
n_lru_nuked                                - objects that were forced from the cache due to space (rather than ttl) constraints

0 Emergency: system is unusable
1 Alert: action must be taken immediately
2 Critical: critical conditions
3 Error: error conditions
4 Warning: warning conditions
5 Notice: normal but significant condition
6 Informational: informational messages

PRIORITY = ( FACILITY * 8 ) + SEVERITY

e.g
kernel.emergency = ( 0 * 8 )  + 0 = 0

LAWS, PRINCIPLES AND PHENOMENA
------------------------------
## Little's law
L = Î»W. The average number of requests in a system is equal to the average arrival rate (req/s) multiplied by the average response time (s/req)

PROGRAMMER'S VIRTUES
--------------------
### Laziness
The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy
expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will
find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many
questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. 

### Impatience
The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write
programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or
at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. 

### Hubris
Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that
makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad
things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. 

SSH
---
### Don't care about remote key:
```
$ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null user@host
```

### Escape sequences
```
 ~.   - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions)
 ~B   - send a BREAK to the remote system
 ~C   - open a command line
 ~R   - request rekey
 ~V/v - decrease/increase verbosity (LogLevel)
 ~^Z  - suspend ssh
 ~#   - list forwarded connections
 ~&   - background ssh (when waiting for connections to terminate)
 ~?   - this message
 ~~   - send the escape character by typing it twice
(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)
```

SSH AUTHORIZED_KEYS
-------------------
Config is placed (comma-separated) at the start of the line, e.g

```
from="10.11.12.13",command="/usr/bin/foo",no-pty ssh-rsa ABC123 comment
```

### command="foo"
Run command 'foo' when this key is used, regardless of what the user requested.
Command user passed is available through $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND

### environment="FOO=bar"
Set environment variable FOO to 'bar'

### from="pattern-list"
Only allow this key to be used from hosts specified. [*?] available as wildcards. Comma-separated

### no-agent-forwarding
Don't allow client to forward their ssh agent

### no-port-forwarding
Don't allow client to forward ports

### no-pty
Don't allocate a PTY to connection

### no-user-rc
Don't execute user's .ssh/rc file

### no-X11-forwarding
Don't allow X11 forwarding

UNIX PHILOSOPHY
---------------
1. Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
1. Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
1. Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.
1. Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
1. Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
1. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
1. Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debuggingeasier.
1. Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
1. Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.
1. Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
1. Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
1. Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
1. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
1. Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
1. Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
1. Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for âone true wayâ.
1. Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.

CONNASCENCE
-----------
Describes level of complexity introduced through relationships/dependencies

### Static
- Name - e.g method names
- Type - e.g string
- Meaning/Convention - e.g 1==true
- Position - positional parameters
- Algorithm - e.g MAC or hashing algorithms

### Dynamic
- Execution - e.g order of execution is important
- Timing - e.g timing of multiple components is important
- Values - e.g when several values must change together
- Identity - e.g when multiple components must reference the same identity

ALICE & BOB
-----------
Common characters in cryptology

- Alice: main participant
- Bob: main participant
- Carol/Carlos/Charlie: generic character
- Dan/David: generic character
- Eve: an eavesdropper. Passive attacker who can observe, but not modify messages
- Frank: generic character
- Grace: government representative
- Mallory: a malicious active attacker who can observe and modify messages
- Trudy: an intruder 

12/TWELVE FACTOR APPS
---------------------
1. **Codebase**. One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
1. **Dependencies**. Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
1. **Config**: Store config in the environment
1. **Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
1. **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
1. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
1. **Port binding**: Export services via port binding
1. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
1. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
1. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
1. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
1. **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

UTILISATION SATURATION AND ERRORS (USE)
---------------------------------------
- **Utilisation**: the average time that the resource was busy servicing work OR the amount of capacity consumed
- **Saturation**: the degree to which the resource has extra work which it can't service, often queued
- **Errors**: the count of error events

RATE/ERRORS/DURATION (RED)
--------------------------
- **Rate**: requests per second
- **Errors**: failed requests per second
- **Duration**: distribution of response time per request
